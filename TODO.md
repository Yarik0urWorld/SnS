0.4:
---------
 * Add some sort of pause menu (and merge it with help menu)
 * Add a second weapon, it will be a gun from first versions (only if I will find the sources (I have found))
 * Give snowmen some color
 * Add mouse controls

0.3.1:
---------
 * Add MinGW support, and use it on Windows rather than Pelles C.
 * Clean up the code (model compilation was a bad idea)
