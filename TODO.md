0.3.1:

1. Clean up the code (model compilation was a bad idea)
2. Add a second weapon, it will be a gun from first versions (only if I will find the sources (I have found))
3. Add some sort of pause menu (and merge it with help menu)
4. Add MinGW support, and use it on Windows rather than Pelles C.
5. Give snowmen some color
