    I'm having big holidays at the moment and I have decided to continue developing SnS.
    And, to make more people intrested, SnS becomes opensource!

    I have finally decided that SnS will be a game engine.
    But, still strange and unusual...

    SnS will not be a clone of Tank Recon 3D. I'm thinking of
    making a proper engine out of SnS source.

    SnS is now a prototype and will be transformed into another game.
    It will be a clone of Tank Recon 3D (see https://lonedwarfgames.com)
